## TableView
This project is made for showing how to write a table view quickly.
Considering the uncertainty demand of table and reducing the dependencies in your project, 
this custom view has no maven or jcenter dependency for you,just copy [TableLayout.java](https://github.com/shineM/TableView/tree/master/app/src/main/java/me/texy/tableview/demo/tableview)
and [attrs.xml](https://github.com/shineM/TableView/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/attrs.xml) to your project，then rewrite or enjoy it.
You can check out the demo for more detail usage.
